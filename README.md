## 🚀 Overview

In academic environments, especially in engineering and design programs, teamwork is essential — yet most student teams are formed by chance rather than capability.  

SkillSync solves this problem by offering a centralized digital platform for:

- Finding teammates with complementary skills
- Connecting with mentors (faculty/seniors) for guidance
- Managing projects collaboratively in a single dashboard

The goal is to make collaboration smart, data-driven, and impactful.
